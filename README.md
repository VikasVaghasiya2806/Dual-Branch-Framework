# 🛡️ Dual-Branch Deep Learning Framework for Face Spoof Detection

This repository contains the implementation of our paper:  
**"A Dual-Branch Deep Learning Framework for Robust Face Spoof Detection Using Spatial and Frequency Representations"**  
by Vikas Vaghasiya, Disha Shimpi, Chhavi Dhiman, and Ashish Phophalia.

> 🚀 A robust face anti-spoofing model combining EfficientNet-based spatial attention with handcrafted ELBP and FFT descriptors. Evaluated on CASIA-FASD, Replay-Attack, and MSU-MFSD.

## ✅ Highlights

- 🔍 **EfficientNet-B0 + Spatial Attention** for RGB feature extraction.
- 🧠 **Handcrafted Descriptors**: ELBP for micro-textures, FFT for spectral distortions.
- 🔗 **Dual-Branch Fusion** for enhanced spoof detection.
- 📊 **Ablation Studies** with Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC, and EER.
- 💡 **Extensive Evaluation** across three public datasets.
